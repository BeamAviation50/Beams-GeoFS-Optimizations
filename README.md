Welcome to GeoFS Advanced Resolutions and more! Here you can play geofs in any resolution above 1080p! Have a 4k Monitor? GeoFS in 4K!
Also, It has been a while since I last updated this, so expect an update in a week or so (cough cough upscaling)

How to use:
1. Download the js script
2. Open in Notepad
3. Copy the script
4. insert it into geofs by pressing f12 then going to console
5. Adjust the resolution as needed

Please do not use a resolution higher than your monitors support as it will just be a waste of FPS. If your graphics card is meant for 1440p and you have a 1440p monitor, use 2K listed in the release.
Also, this affects VRAM too. It has been tested and I can tell you it does use VRAM like any other Triple-A game or flight simulator.

Enjoy!
